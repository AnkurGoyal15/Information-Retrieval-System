In the following steps, I will discuss how I approached the problem of quora question pairs and the motivation for coming up with an architecture like Siamese network.

<b><ins>How and why I chose the Siamese based network?</ins></b>
<ul>
  <li>Having worked on computer vision in domains like medical imaging, biometrics, and document image super-resolution, I approached the problem of deciding the architecture for the quora question pairs dataset based on specifically biometrics.</li>
   <li>While I was working on medical imaging at IIT Mandi, I also worked on a bit of biometrics domain wherein I had palm & knuckle print images of the left & right hand. Similar to that, in this problem I had question 1 & question 2 as an input. Hence, I went with the best possible approach of using a <b>Siamese based network.</b></li>
   <li>Even though the task was to find from a pool of questions which top-3 questions are closer to the user inputted question, to solve this problem, classifying given two questions are they similar or dissimilar was essential. The dataset had same questions repeated multiple times against different set of questions, so the network learned meaningful and discriminative features which eventually helped in solving the prime task of finding top-3 suggestions.</li>
   <li>A siamese network had two inputs and it works on a phenomenon of sharing weights. The networkâ€™s input was question 1 and question 2 as tokenized vectors each of length 103, label being 0 or 1.
</li>
   <li>I tried a variety of architectures for the siamese network. Note that there are three functions in my network namely Embedding, Siamese, Predict. Following are some of architectural changes I made in my siamese function:
